# Children

In React, children is a special prop that allows components to wrap and render other components or elements inside them. It enables reusability and flexibility when building UI structures.

Simple Example of a Component Using children
A Card component that can wrap and display any content:

const Card = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
return (
<div className="border p-4 shadow-md rounded-lg">
{children}
</div>
);
};

export default Card;

# How to Use It

<Card>
  <h2>Title</h2>
  <p>This is a description inside the card.</p>
</Card>
